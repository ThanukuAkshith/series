               <p> In Episode 1 of Money Heist Season 1, the story begins with a young woman named Tokyo, a fugitive on the run after a failed robbery left her wanted by the police. She’s approached by a mysterious man known as "The Professor," who offers her a chance at redemption through a meticulously planned heist. He gathers a group of eight criminals, each with unique skills and nothing to lose, giving them city names as aliases—Tokyo, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Moscow, Helsinki, and Oslo. Their target: the Royal Mint of Spain, where they plan to print billions of euros without stealing a single existing bill.

As the operation begins, the robbers infiltrate the Mint wearing red jumpsuits and Salvador Dalí masks, taking 67 hostages, including the director of the Mint and a key figure, Alison Parker, the daughter of the British ambassador. Meanwhile, The Professor oversees the heist remotely, controlling every move and anticipating police actions. Tensions rise quickly as the hostages panic and authorities begin strategizing a response. The episode ends with a sense of suspense, laying the foundation for the psychological warfare, twists, and emotional drama that will unfold throughout the series.</p>

                <p>In this episode, the heist intensifies inside the Royal Mint of Spain as the robbers begin printing €50 notes after outfitting all hostages in red jumpsuits and giving them fake guns. Tokyo’s impulsive shooting of police—stemming from a misunderstanding involving Rio—threatens the Professor’s carefully crafted plan. Berlin asserts control, isolates Alison Parker (revealed to be the British Ambassador’s daughter), and forces her to make a public declaration, intensifying the political stakes. Meanwhile, tension builds outside; Inspector Raquel Murillo steps in as negotiator but is challenged by Colonel Prieto’s aggressive intervention. Prieto’s plan to storm the Mint with a camera-equipped robot backfires when they discover the robbers are heavily armed </p>
                <p>Beneath the action, cracks begin to form in the robbers’ unity.

Meanwhile, Raquel struggles to strike a balance between diplomacy and authority, especially after Alison’s status as a VIP hostage makes her rescue priority.

                <p>In Season 2, Episode 1 of Money Heist, the tension inside the Royal Mint escalates as the hostages grow more restless and the police intensify their investigation.

Meanwhile, internal conflicts start to build within the gang, particularly between Berlin and Tokyo, whose impulsive nature threatens the fragile control Berlin tries to maintain over the situation.

Outside the Mint, Raquel moves closer to discovering the Professor’s true identity. She begins to question the coincidences surrounding Salva and starts piecing together evidence that could expose him. Inside, the robbers are also working against the clock to complete the heist and dig their escape tunnel. Emotions run high, relationships deepen, and the complexity of each character begins to unfold more, making the stakes even more personal and dangerous as the plan inches forward amidst growing chaos.</p>

                <p>As the episode progresses, the Professor’s control begins to fray. Raquel starts suspecting Salva’s true identity after receiving forensic results that contradict the supposed clues planted at the Toledo farmhouse. Meanwhile, the Professor has to think on his feet, especially during his encounter with Raquel’s ex-husband, Alberto. To avoid exposure, he resorts to violence—knocking Alberto unconscious and sabotaging the evidence—showing just how far he’s willing to go to keep his identity hidden. This moment marks a turning point in the Professor’s moral line, highlighting the pressure and intensity of the ongoing heist from outside the Mint.

Inside, Tokyo’s rebellion causes serious consequences. Her impulsiveness puts the entire operation at risk. Berlin, who is often brutal but strategic, sees her as a threat to the mission’s success. After Tokyo is expelled from the Mint and captured by police, it deeply affects Río, who is emotionally shattered and begins questioning his role and trust in the plan. The team becomes increasingly divided, with Nairobi trying to keep the group stable. The episode ends on a tense cliffhanger, emphasizing how internal chaos and external threats are tightening the noose around both the heist crew and the Professor.</p>
